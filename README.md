# Distributed-TPU-Training

Google Colab offers options to use GPUs and TPUs as hardware accelerators.  
While this can already significantly increase the training speed, 
we can increase the speed even further by distributing trainig over a pool of these accelerators.  

This is an illustration of how to define a distribution strategy and train a model in a distributed way.
